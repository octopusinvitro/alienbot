## Requirements

You need to install `pipenv` for dependency management. Check dependency versions of python and libraries in the `Pipefile`.

To install dependencies, create and activate an environment, then run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

## Run

```bash
. bin/run
```

## Test

```bash
. bin/test
```

To test a specific file:

```bash
. bin/test tests/path/to/test_file.py
```
